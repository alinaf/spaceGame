This is the login program written by Java Swing frame.<br>

Here is some problems to be solved:<br>
  1. I found the executable file and packed it into deploy_win/ folder but my program still couldn't execute it. don't know why.<br>
  2. database is hard-coded. 
    Database Name: CS201Proj
    has a table: Users
      has three columns: userID, userName, userPassword
  3. the gif background seems to play once. I'm figuring how to make it repeated.
